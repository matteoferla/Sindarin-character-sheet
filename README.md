# Sindarin-character-sheet
A character sheet for Dungeons and Dragons 5e written in Sindarin (Tolkien modern elvish).

I made this a decade ago (2014) when D&D Next (5e) was released and I was writing up my thesis.
It has some errors which I will not fix â€”I have unfortunately not had the time to play this great game in years and years.
I am simply sharing it on GitHub as the original forum I shared it on is no more and everywhere else seems to have link rot.

The words are neosindarin where possible and calques if not available.
It is not a translitteration in Tengwar (the script) from English.
