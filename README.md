# Sindarin-character-sheet
A character sheet for Dungeons and Dragons 5e written in Sindarin (Tolkien modern elvish).

I made this a decade ago (2014) when D&D Next (5e) was released and I was writing up my thesis.
I have unfortunately not had the time to play this great game in years and years.
I am simply archiving it on GitHub as the original forum I shared it on is no more and everywhere else seems to have link rot.
Hopefully by putting it here it will stay until the Dagar Dagaroth.
Please note I will likely not respond to any requests.

The Illustrator files require the font [Tengwar Parmaite](https://fontsgeek.com/tengwar-parmaite-font).

See PDFs for different versions.

See [here](elvish%20runic.jpg) for a random example of it filled in English futhorc runes
(with dot modifiers for missing phonemes) and arabic numerals for sanity.

### Translation
The words are neosindarin where possible and calques if not available (see [more](https://squidonius.blogspot.com/2014/11/d-character-sheet-in-sindarin.html?m=1#more)).
It is not a translitteration in Tengwar (the script) from English.

It has some errors which I will not fix.

* Constitution was translated as `t√ª`, but `bronwe` endurance works better
* the wrong letter for `y` is used (y in Quenya is double underdotted)
* Hero, `thalion`, is typoed to `tailon`
* Player, `telior`, is bad-grammar-typoed yo `teliadir`
